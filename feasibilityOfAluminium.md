# FEASIBILITY OF ALUMINUM FABRICATION

Fabrication is the process of shaping Aluminum into a finished product. It spans into a variety of processes such as welding, bending, shearing, stamping and extruding.

The feasibility of aluminum fabrication in rocketry depends on the specific application and requirements of the rocket. However, in general, aluminum is a suitable material for use in rocketry due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, which is important in the aerospace industry. In rocketry, aluminum alloys such as 6061 and 7075 are commonly used in the construction of rocket motor cases, fuel tanks, and other structural components. These alloys have good machinability, weldability, and corrosion resistance, which are important properties for rocketry applications.

> #### Grade AA 6061
> - Easy to weld.
> - High corrosion resistance.
> - Gives a shiny finish.

> #### Grade AA 7075
> - Easy to machine
> - Offers a steel like strength

Aluminum is also used in the production of rocket nozzles, which must be able to withstand high temperatures and pressures during flight. Aluminum alloys such as Al-Li (aluminum-lithium) are used for this purpose as they have a higher strength at high temperatures compared to other aluminum alloys. Additionally, aluminum can be easily recycled and is a relatively inexpensive material, which also makes it a desirable option for many manufacturers.

In summary, aluminum fabrication is feasible in rocketry and it is a commonly used material in the aerospace industry. However, the feasibility of a specific aluminum part in a rocket will depend on the requirements and the design of the rocket.

### ADVANTAGES OF ALUMINUM PRODUCTION

- Aluminum is an easy metal to work with thanks to its comparative softness, corrosion resistance, and recyclability.
- Aluminum is also malleable, which makes it highly adaptable to shaping and extension.
- Its non-toxicity has made it a popular choice for food preparation machinery, and its reflective and non-combustive properties have also cemented its place in lighting.

### DRAWBACKS OF ALUMINUM PRODUCTION

- At the same time, this softness and weakness compared to stainless steel can make for less sturdy end products. 
- Thanks to its thermal conductivity, many types of aluminum can also be difficult to weld for the inexperienced because it can easily be melted through. 
- Certain stresses can also cause aluminum to break, as it can be brittle in some ways from manufacturing processes.
- There is the issue of low melting point, which will require the need of an insulation material after fabrication.

### CONCERN 
Due to the low melting point of Aluminium:
* Some processing methods such as cutting and welding might pose a hinderance during fabrication if care is not taken. This however can be avoided.
* Secondly, we need to take care of the type of insulation to be done on the airframe of our rocket if Aluminium is to be used. The choice of the appropriate insulation is yet to be determined. 

#### CONCLUSION
There was a suggestion to use the 2 series grade aluminium. The only concern was that this series was heavier something close to steel. This was voted against.

Coming to the two recommended grades of aluminium, the 6 series posses for better fabrication and quality. Therefore, we suggest the grade AA 6061 Aluminum alloy for this proposed rocket.
