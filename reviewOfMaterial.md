> The selection of the type of Aluminium to be used can best be done by understanding which type of grade to use. 
>
> The following two types of grades stood out from my findings.
>
> #### Grade 2024-T3 
>
> - Excellent fatigue resistance.
> - Shiny surface finish.
> - Ideal for repairs and restoration.
>
> #### Grade 6061-T6
> - Easy to weld.
> - High corrosion resistance.
> - Gives a shiny finish.

## STABILITY OF THE ROCKET

The following is a discussion concerning the stability of the intended n3 rocket. Stability can be increased by the following few ways:
* Lowering the center of pressure.
* Increasing the fin area, placing the fins equidistant from each other, the shape of the fins should be streamlines and somewhat long to improve the stability of the rocket.
* Raising the center of gravity.
* Adding weight to the Nose cone area.

The oblective in our case is to realise a rocket that is both stable and one that has good balance. That is, a rocket that will follow a straight trajectory once launched. 

In order for a rocket to stabilise, the center of pressure must be behind the center of mass i.e close to the rear end. In the case after launch the rocket has a displacement away from the expected path, the rocket experiences a non-zero displacement angle, and its lift and drag generates a restoring torque about its center of mass which re-directs the rocket to its correct path.

In a scenario where the center of pressure is before the center of mass, the generated restoring torque will be outweighed by both the lift and drag as suuch the rocket will keep tilting away from the straight path trajectory.
