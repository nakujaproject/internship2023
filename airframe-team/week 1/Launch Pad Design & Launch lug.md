# **LAUNCH PAD DESIGN + LAUNCH LUG**

### Launch Pad
The purpose of a launch pad is to guide the rocket until it is moving fast enough for there to be fast airflow over its fins for stability. It also prevents the engine flame from hitting the launch pad or ground, preventing fire. Likewise, it can allow the rocket to be launched at angle from the vertical as desired.
The basic parts of a launch pad include:
1.	Base 
-	It holds and supports everything. 
-	It can be made of any material that is structurally stable.
-	It should be big and heavy enough to provide a firm foundation. The heavier the rocket, the heavier the base that is required.
2.	Blast deflector
-	It protects the launch pad and the ground from fires by deflecting the engine exhaust away.
-	The blast deflector need not be sophisticated. It can be as simple as food lids and a piece of tile. 
3.	Launch rod(s) 
-	 Its purpose is to guide the rocket on its initial flight path until the fins can guide the flight.
-	Steel or brass rods can be used. Stainless steel is particularly suitable since it is resistant to corrosion.
-	There is no standard length for the rod. However, it should be long enough to allow the rocket to accelerate to safe speed when it leaves the rod.
-	Through simulation the speed and altitude of the rocket is analysed, from which the length of the rod can be determined.

### Launch Lug
The launch lug engages with the launch rod to make the rocket stable as it accelerates to safe speed during its initial flight before it leaves the launch pad. They are attached to the rocket body and should be placed about the center of gravity. Launch lugs should be small to reduce the effect on the rocket aerodynamics but strong enough to hold the rocket upright in the desired trajectory.
